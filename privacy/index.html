    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> October 2025</p>
    <p>YearMap is a Chrome extension developed by Spring Harbor Studios. We believe in simplicity, privacy, and transparency.</p>

    <h2>What Data We Collect</h2>
    <p>YearMap stores only your display settings, categories, notes, and calendar ranges via Chrome’s <code>storage</code> APIs. This data is saved locally in your browser and may optionally sync across your Chrome profile if you have sync enabled. We never request personal identifiers or contact information.</p>

    <h2>No Analytics or Tracking</h2>
    <p>We do not embed analytics, trackers, cookies, or any third-party monitoring scripts. We do not collect or transmit personal data.</p>

    <h2>External Links to Support or Donations</h2>
    <p>YearMap may provide links to external websites for support or donations—such as our Buy Me a Coffee page (<a href="https://buymeacoffee.com/dvansickle" rel="noopener noreferrer">buymeacoffee.com/dvansickle</a>) or support email links. Clicking these links opens the external site; any data you share on those sites is handled under their privacy policies. YearMap does not send your personal data to those services—these links simply direct your browser to them.</p>

    <h2>Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p>YearMap is intended for general users and is not directed at children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children.</p>

    <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this policy as YearMap evolves. If we make significant changes, we’ll update the date above and post the new version at this same URL. Continued use after changes constitutes acceptance.</p>

    <h2>Contact</h2>
    <p>If you have privacy questions or concerns, email <a href="mailto:support@yearmap.app">support@yearmapp.app</a>.</p>
